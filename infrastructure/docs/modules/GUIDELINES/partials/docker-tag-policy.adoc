Use the following pattern to assign versions to Docker images.

. Version tag (e.g. `1.0.0`) = Image release (= the repository is tagged with v1.0.0)
. `latest` = synonym for the latest released version
. `stable` = synonym for latest (optional)
. `ci-build` = build from branch (main or feature), possibly unstable
. `release-candidate` = build from release branch
. `dev` = tag used during development on localhost
